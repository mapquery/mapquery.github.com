#Build files for the website

##demo-index.html
This file will become http://mapquery.org/demo/index.html Currently it's created 
by hand. In the future it should be automatically created from the contents of
/demo and probably some kind of start-content doc.

##main.md
This markdown file contains the text that is shown in http://mapquery.org/docs/

##template.html
This file is used by jodoc-js to generate the API docs
